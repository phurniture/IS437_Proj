# Grinnell Final Proj.

## Narrative
This project will allow for multiple users to create collections of trading cards and keep them organized and easily accessible as well as allowing for selling of cards on a user to user basis.

All these operations will be carried out by a normal type of user and will all be organized by an administrator user.

The administrator user will be able to manage users as well as managing the types of collections
on the site. 

This projectâ€™s purpose is to allow users with multiple types of cards and collections an easy way to keep a running catalog of their collections, as well as to offer a place for users to expand their collection from like minded users.

Some assumptions made for this project were that user name cards and collections and such correctly as they are written on the card to allow for simple indexing, that all users are will and able to user the shop feature if they so desire regardless of age or other legal stipulations, and that the admins would have personal user accounts separate from their administrative accounts if they wanted to use the sites services.
